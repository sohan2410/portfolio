Developed Docker-based sandbox to run code in an isolated and secured environment. It supports languages like C, C++, Python, Java & JavaScript.

Application is made infinitely scalable by utilizing the concept of server-less architecture, which is implemented with the
help of the Serverless Framework and AWS Lambda Functions.

Docker was used to containerize the application which contains all the required dependencies and that image is utilized for AWS Lambda functions.
